# IOT-Temp-Alert

## Info

It is an IOT project that uses ESP8266 module send a alert to your Twitter Account, SMS, Email when the temperature of a room increases above a certain threshold (in my case it is 25 deg Celcius). It could be highly useful for a person who need to know the live temperature of a room where some highly temperature sensitive material is kept.

The code checks the room temperature in every 10 seconds.
